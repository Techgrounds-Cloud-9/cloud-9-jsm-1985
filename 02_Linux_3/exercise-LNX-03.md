#  Working with CLI
In Linux when compared to OS like Windows(which is more GUI focused), all the commands are done via command line interface(CLI). There are the standard inputs(keyboards) and outputs(terminal), but they can be redirected using approprite commnads as well. 

## Key terminology

  1. std inut and output
  2. redirection of outputs so that it becomes the input of another command using pipe 
  3. echo command-to print to terminal as well as to append to a file
  4. grep command - to filter lines in a file.combined with cat it can be used to filter the output from a file.
  5. Difference between > and >> operators
